Mini Task Scheduler is a simple and interactive web application that allows users to manage their daily tasks using the stack data structure in Python. The tasks follow the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle — meaning the most recently added task is the first to be removed.

The project includes:

A visually appealing frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

A functional backend written in Python that manages task operations (add, view, remove) using a stack.

Each task can include:

Title

Description

Scheduled Time

Priority level (High/Medium/Low)

🎯 Features:
🟣 Add tasks with a name, detailed description, time, and priority.

🔃 View tasks with the latest added task at the top (LIFO behavior).

❌ Delete the most recent task or any task via a "Delete" button.

🌈 Clean and modern UI with a unique color palette and hover animations.

💡 Real-time task updates on the frontend.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS (custom design), JavaScript

Backend: Python (Flask or standalone logic using CLI for core DSA stack concept)
